I'm looking for a nominally paid role where I can contribute in a meaningful way to a team. 

ü§ù A technical boffin with more than 30 years of expertise in Internet infrastructure, operational IT (information-tech) systems, cybersecurity, software design & cloud optimization ‚Äúdev/ops‚Äù.  

I üíñ Git, Bash, Rust, TypeScript ({Vue3}), Python(3), WASM, SQL(*), OS({Linux,Win11}), Cloud({Azure,AWS})

I use exclusively open-source tools and give-back as a contributor of documentation, issues & patches, answering questions, and participating in a variety of project communities.  (Attempting to fill whatever role I think that project needs in that moment as a way to level-up my own skills.)

I have the foundations to quickly grok systems & diagnose issues including the low level foundations of Operating Systems (especially disk & i/o), TCP/IP engineering ‚Äòbest patterns & practices‚Äô, and implementing RFC protocol documents.  A 30+ career with significant expertise in cybersecurity, systems engineering, very large databases, API & microservice architectures & neo-modern development languages & systems patterns. 

I spent the past few years (since 2016) upskilling especially in AI/ML & NLU/LLM (reproducing papers, jupyter notebooks), embedded systems, as well as some PoS mostly ETH2 blockchain & web3 projects.  I would be keen to find a dev/ops role with some adjacency or requirement to exercise that knowledge investment. 

I am fluent with systems audit & documentary requirements & processes related to PCI, ISO27001, SOX, and GDPR compliance.  I expect to work in or be asked to participate in the architecture & roll-out of a reduced-risk ‚Äòzero-trust‚Äô cybersec posture along with a CI/CD systems build pipeline and verified backup/recovery procedures. 

I prefer to remain as a hands-on engineer and self identify as the mythical 10x contributor & bottom-line oriented organizational problem solver.  I am not the type of person who seeks or enjoys ‚Äòchill‚Äô maintenance roles.   I prefer to be a senior technical lead in limited supervisory leadership roles because optimal config/code output benefits from fewer meetings & context-switches.


### üõ†Ô∏è Technology
My preferred languages are:  ü¶Ä Rust, ü¶Ñ TypeScript, or üêç Python.  I am a üêò PostgreSQL, üêß Linux/Bash, & üêô GIT uber-advanced user.  

 All systems under my locus of control don‚Äôt subscribe to cybersec best-practices (usually SSO & RBAC) and have some level of Agile/TDD & CI/CD to ensure ease of patching.  I abhor working in bespoke ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever patch/reboot‚Äù environments and expect latitude to transition any servers within my administrative locus of control to ‚Äúzero-touch‚Äù (no operators allowed to login) for cybersec, audit & version control reasons. 

I can often muster solutions & workarounds others would regard as ‚Äònot-realistic‚Äô because I  am fluent & proficient at many specialized tools such as regex, git, bash/cli, unix pipes, ipc, rpc, ssh, sockets, tcp/ip networking & messaging protocols, or peg parsers to name just a few examples. I bring a wealth of ‚Äòknow-howto‚Äô to teams where I participate and my goal is usually to help developers need to write less code and finish projects sooner. 

### ü¶ñ Historical Background

My professional career at a young age in 1990 was later involved in US advocacy for open-source & Linux.  I have successful fashioned & worn many hats and managed critical safety-services (911 dispatch & other ‚Äòpeople die during downtime‚Äô roles) as a Unix System Administration, TCP/IP Internetwork engineering, firewalls & Internet protocols, then e-commerce backend dev/ops (mostly nginx, mysql, perl, bash, chef/ansible) & client/server SPA (single page application).  I have built and consulted as a paid independent validator & security test-engineer for REST API‚Äôs responsible for billions in online commerce and was the CTO of a recognized important business partner of eBay, Amazon, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, FedEx and others.   

I like to adopt & promote novel best practices that will reduce errors/increase determinstic bheavior.  This includes TDD with GIT (pre-AGILE manifesto), and later CD/CI pipelines (Ansible & Git Actions).  Amazon was a business partner and I started on the AWS Cloud in 2008 and started to migrate my projects to Azure in 2017 (mostly for its superior artificial intelligence API‚Äôs).   I have excellent fluency with both SRE & data-engineering SQL optimization (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDb, AWS Redshift, MS-SQL & many others) and also several popular NoSQL, GraphQL, Redis, memcache along with a diverse variety of dev/ops & cloud tools such as k8s, aws-cli IAM, azure AD/ARM/Bicep, and async event messaging patterns such as Airflow/DAGs, Kafka, Redis and many others.  I‚Äôve written software and/or built high volume infrastructure for SMTP, DNS, HTTP & websockets. I‚Äôve worked with low-latency real time video/audio transmission, transcoding (and deepfaking), SIP/TURN/STUN, RTP protocols capture & debugging stack traces, whatever is necessary.

My systems engineer toolbox includes TRIZ/TIPS,  less-wrong antifragile and a bias toward DRY (don‚Äôt repeat yourself or reinvent wheels).  


# PRIOR WORK EXPERIENCE

<i>I do not list small consulting projects or personal projects or engagements which are less than 6 months on this resume.</i>

## Profectus Group
Role: Director of Systems Engineering (Reporting to CTO)
June 2021 - Oct 2021

Profectus is not a well known company, but it‚Äôs nearly impossible to shop in Australia or New Zealand without your transactional data appearing in a Profectus database.  
    * Sept 2021 - peer award ‚Äòemployee of the month‚Äô for INTEGRITY
    * managed pre-selected team of 3.5 persons (did no hiring of my own)  1.5 members were very junior and eager to learn, one IT helpdesk/AD admin, and one long-tenured employees ‚Äòlegacy-systems‚Äô
    * operated during AU social isolation quarantines imposed by covid a
    * My team oversaw AD admin & all IT helpdesk desktop system issues & security for ~180 users spanning three countries.
    * Profectus is/was contractually required to pass ISO27001 security & SOX compliance audits requirement due to sensitivy of client ERP data.
    * In total there were more than 200 named TLA services in ~40 separate physical very large servers. 
    * I worked directly with the recently appointed CEO & new CTO to map/document future-org hierarchy in AD & demonstrated client/employee data-governance policies to the organization Active Directory + Cloud NGAC (Next Generation Access Control, password-less security).
    * I coordinated everything with 3 senior and a dozen junior developers & test-QA on applications in Java 8 mysql, postgres, & .Net/mssql, and maintained a myriad of legacy systems as diverse as Windows XP, Windows 2000, SQL server 2008.  
    * My team performed various Outlook, Office365 & Sharepoint administration, MS Teams, and attempted to social JIRA prone but otherwise non-technical product owners & developers to better-DRTW patterns such as Docker, Airflow/DAG, GraphQL, & Monday.com GraphQL API integration. 
    * Supported the Data-engineering (data-integrity) team by co-proposing/designing & evangelizing a single unified ETL pipeline using Apache Kafka & Snowflake.   
    * Evaluate alternative BI tools & documented failures in an oversold, overprovisioned tool.
    * Data Center Migration - hit the ground running, during the first 3 months of the engagement the biggest priority was a looming (~4 months remaining deadline) to complete a "tech-lead has quit" unfinished data-center colo facility migration (due to building demolition, it was ‚Äònon-extendable‚Äô, working around covid snap lockdowns & 30 day client-notification maintenance windows). 
    * The colo relo project was two cabinets of ‚Äòhighly interconnected & complex‚Äô multi-interface systems containing critical and ‚Äònever rebooted/tested‚Äô HA servers without build scripts.   
    * I personally transferred more than 300tb of ZFS snapshots which literally took months due to what was ultimately due to be a buggy network driver version of RHEL/CentOS on Azure incompatibility from my predecessor.
    * On my last day at ~7:30pm, I delivered after much work, a documented docker build script & Azure cloud operating MVP of a primary service (RDM) that was responsible for ~$3.5m in annual revenue
    * Prior to my arrival RDM only existed as an on-premise server that could never be turned off and which was built in a way that could not patch/upgrade Linux beyond Ubuntu 14 due to design flaw where a previous dev had been allowed to design their own k8s, using non-systemd sysv-init + LXC/c-groups & select-block-copy-edit non-compositional Atlassian confluence docs stored bash commands & undocumented Clojure scripts operated (but not understood) by many different people & departments.  
    * During this process my team identified a required missing-library binary-only component of the RDM applications internal source code which had been lost/deleted by developers (so only historically already-compiled binaries existed), where there was no obvious solution to ‚Äòfix‚Äô.
