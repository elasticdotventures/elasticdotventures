WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)

WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is a lightweight standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with small footprint, high performance and highly configurable features for applications cross from embedded, IoT, edge to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), smart contract, cloud native and so on. 
X86-64, X86-32
ARM, THUMB (ARMV7 Cortex-M7 and Cortex-A15 are tested)
AArch64 (Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 are tested)
RISCV64, RISCV32 (RISC-V LP64 and RISC-V LP64D are tested)
XTENSA, MIPS, ARC

trunk
Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

# RuST WASM
- evaluate of webassembly and ebpf as offloading mechanisms

- wasm-pack expects project to be a library, not executable
- can use
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
path = "src/main.rs"

Second, we need (at least) two dependencies: wasm-bindgen and web-sys. The first one does not have any particularities, but the second one, web-sys, does. It is used to access JavaScript APIs.
üëç really good article.
