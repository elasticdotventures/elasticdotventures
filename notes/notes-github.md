This document is the Fungible.Farm README.md
The is hosted on GitHub as a Private Repository.
GIT is ubiquitous in software development and has advanced capabilities for distributed software authoring & versioning. 

For many people this will be your first encounter with GIT.
GIT is a version control system that is used to build the Internet.

Using the GIT utility it is possible for any person to edit or create a text file within the repository and for others to review those changes before they are 'merged into master' (software terminology for "accepted") as part of a "PULL REQUEST".  The GIT approach makes the resulting entity more competitive by having a "single source of truth" for documents. 

Github has features such as Issues and the ability to leave comments as well as record chat into the git-repo.  It also allows point in time recovery and the ability to do 'branching' which is considering a competitive advantage for a tech-focus company.
