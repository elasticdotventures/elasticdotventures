Simplified Pinyin is a pretty font - in fact it's designed to be more legible than traditional chinese on electronic devices.  More complex glyphs can be used by our primate-pattern matching brains. 
Simplified Pinyin is useful in a LOT of places (such as Cloud Azure/AWS/GCP Resource Names) or DNS where Emoji is not normally found.  Thus DNS names which can be up to 65 characters can actually contain a lot of semantic information using this notation.  This hidden semantic can be revealed with a translator.  Pinyin/Emoji also has the ability to be more affordably digested by a plurality of filters and search algorithms (compared to their latin-western sets) bandwidth & data processing fees when you think about reducing the names of payloads & strings (saving memory, bandwdith, storage, etc.) 

Chinese pictograms are essentially the "original" black & white Emoji. HSK1 contains roughly ~500 word-meanings in a single character position (screen real-estate).  When we talk about Good naming conventions -- i.e. logic-role, _b00t_ tries to use uniform fixed width sequences 1-4 characters to hint, so Emoji + Mandarin-Pinyin. 

If _b00t_ was restricted to ONLY the western English 36 characters (A-Z,0-9) that would results in ~1.6m possible combinations & meanings and probably a dozen abbreviated words at most, not descriptive at all!   Those same 4 character positions using 1024 Emojis (~1.9tn), plus 500 HSK1 mandarin characters (~62.5bn), in total 1560 characters (36+1024+500) results in 5.9 TRILLION possible "stories" encoded in only 4 characters for a primate brain to process! 

Wow, so 4 characters of _b00t_ can represent *5.9 TRILLION stories*! ü§Ø With *DEFAULT* English mode, the system will append the English. Keyboard translations in Windows & VS Code Extensions are coming, templates for cutting and pasting are herein. 

_b00t_ is quicker-than-you'd-think to learn (our brains like patterns) after a short while you'll learn the ÊÑè (Y√¨, English: "Meaning of") Chinese characters, till then just cut and paste from the samples, navigate with pictures, some vocabulary is included in files. ü™ÑüòÅ! now you're learning to read basic Pinyin!  Chinese Mandarin (Pinyin users) represent 1.8 billion humans, roughly 1/3rd of the population.  English also has roughly 1.8bn globally -- HOWEVER only 400m are native speakers, everybody else already speaks another language besides English first! Emoji is universal.
