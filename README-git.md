# \_b00t_ is a Git Template

## What Makes Templates Special?
Forking a project brings all the history with it. 
Using a remote template creates a fresh snapshot as if the entire repository was created in one single commit.  If you keep your t00ling in _b00t_ or in place with wrappers in the b00t cli.  Then install modules as normal. 

## Fork vs. Base Template
The *preferred* method of integrating a new app is to
introduce b00t gently. Installing the libraries and treating your software as a project (in which case there is no reason to introduce _b00t_ beyond a clone to /c0de)

HOWEVER if you want to introduce b00t to your own tooling, then you'd want to merge the histories. 

create a new repo.

GIT based local caching filesystem, it only downloads files
when they are accessed such that subsequent reads will be much 
faster. commits can be made in directories using branches?
