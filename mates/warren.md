curvature blade impeller pump as turbine

https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4968261


Pump as turbine or PAT 
Create a tank, with water at the bottom & air at the top
air pressure, builds up pushes water down to low pressure chamber
archimedes hydrodynamic screw pulls water up spinning motor (using DC)
(which pulls air into the system)

A propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the propellant more efficiently.
