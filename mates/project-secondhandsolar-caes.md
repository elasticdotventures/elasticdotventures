"Second Hand Solar Panels" & CAES

the elevator pitch: basically there are millions of solar panels being removed & replaced on roofs around the world 
the number of panels is likely to continue and grow in the future.  Many of these will regretably end up in landfills.

this is intended to develop a CAES "Clean Air Energy Storage" mechanism that charges with variable frequency based on 
PV and a 

Air is an example of a compressible fluid; you squish it and it gets smaller
Water is an example of an incompressible fluid; you squish it and it pushes back, and doesn't get any smaller. Incompressible fluids are simpler to simulate because their density and pressure is always constant.


## reasons why people replace solar/panels systems
* systems are replaced due to "infant mortality" of one or more pieces fail outside of the 5-20yr warranty
* weathered systems are "burned in", the output will be highly variable
* out of warranty, labor/install is cheaper &amp; easier to replace entire system
* many panels would probably continue working for double or triple their lifespan *IF* they can be added.

# Using LPG bottles
* The typical propane tank would probably only burst with propane tank max pressure rating over 6895 kPa or 1,000 PSIG
* (the average LPG operating pressure is 1/5th that)

This product is designed to give those panels a second life as "tables" .. but could also go on the roof of a bus-shed, or solar composting toilets .. well suited for applications that require a 'burst' of power.

the team is attached to a well-funded group here in Melbourne.

we're building a very low-tech high-efficiency very-durable CAES (Clean Air Energy Storage) device that generates power - target 100w and someday clean water .. from the air .. maybe hydrogen fuel someday from the that water and power.  .. baby steps, storing air, then on-demand power,  because it doesn't use electro-chemical batteries it isn't horrible for the environment.

I was thinking this might be a good fit for innovation drive as the development/fabrication partner. 

Technically speaking it's unique because I'm targeting used solar panels, direct DC power'd, no inverter losses, mechanical efficiency in terms of 'zero loss' storage of energy, and the plumbing is all pneumatic, so pretty easy to scale & troubleshoot in many applications .. (it could also be powered by a hand crank, or windmill, whatever, any combination of variable rectified dc power sources) .. the output will be USB-C .. 100w enough to power a laptop, cell phone, and optionally (someday) a LORA mesh network .. for low level email wifi/network signals -- using an ESP32

but designing in stages, starting with the CAES aspect.
