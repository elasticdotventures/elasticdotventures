# Introduction to #ETC

Hi Warren & Jamie,

I *really* enjoyed our first face to face on May 28th, 2022.  Thank you so much for hosting @Jamie and myself.   Subsequent convo re: [Solar Table](solar-table.md)

I propose for the calendar invite - a token-placeholder name 'Epicurean Thought Club' [hereafter: #ETC].   The first of many TLA's (Three letter acronyms) to help us move a bit faster. 

I'm a first-principles sort of engineer. Aristotle defined a first principle as ‚Äúthe first basis from which a thing is known.‚Äù
* https://jamesclear.com/first-principles

If either of you are mutually inclined let's please consider setting up a regular 'habitual' weekly or forenightly video call and/or virtual hangout.  Going to try and fast-track some common lingo, and ya'll feel free to put your own spin on these ideas. 

A lot of this foundational.  Mental, software & physical tooling, all the plumbing.  

üçì: RE: #ETC - My schedule is extremely flexible, so I'll suggest Thursday afternoons @ 3:33pm AEST as a proposed recurring virtual call & using async-chat (described later) for the in-between times.  

With #ETC plan activites, projects, outings, bring/propose ideas, invite guests, etc.  nothing too formal (no minutes!), but also providing a bit of structure & goals helps focus, etc. üòÜ no worries.

This way *if* we desired to get together /irl/ [in real life] for #ETC on a Sat/Sun our aging synapses & neurons are still sufficiently wet & plastic.  I'm open to any day or time, but Wed/Thurs is probably best synaptically speaking /imho/ [imho: in my humble opinion].  I will also propose some high level ideas & tooling below with short explanations why.

## Proposal for RFC's

üçì: Proposal's should be written, ideally in separate files called "REQUEST FOR COMMENTS" denoted with #RFC, this is a convention borrowed from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).  Full discussion is beyond scope of this document - but conceptually an RFC is a propsed idea or a way to suggest changes/revisions and reference an earlier RFC. 

The ideas proposed within this document are meant to be investigatory, 'strawman' proposals related to #ETC.  RFC's are usually put together by the group and start with a strawman and there might be a template, or directory folder in a public or private git repo (i'll explain this in a moment).  (this file is hosted in a git repo)

ü§ì strawman: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man  (a mental model), a "dummy idea" or 'dummy token placeholder' that can be attacked without bruising anybodies ego.  The idea is not to necessarily use the strawman, it's to make potential assertions of start points or methods which could be used and toss out the bad ones.  The goal of a strawman is actually actually to invoke discussion without concern for bruising others ego. 

üçì: I propose @ #ETC club, it's (intellectually) rude NOT to take "your best swipe, run-jump face punch, or flying off the ropes drop kick" on a strawman idea somebody has spent time preparing.  I.e. "why this may not work", so that perhaps the plan may be revised at an earlier stage prior to fabrication.   

üçì: These can be denoated as weak or strong arguments, such as in the me-too woke culture we should informaly avoid msyogonstic terminology such as "strawman" and it should be "straw-person" .. and another person might say "what if they identify as a fruit" and suddenly it's a straw-berry: üçì .. so instead of strawman, we can highlight areas or stupid ideas in need of attention using straw-berries, or any mostly red-symbol as a place to bring attention or request feedback.  

üöÄ: The basic idea with using a bit of emoji is to break up the text and give our eyes visual anchor points.  I am also writing this in markdown which is a text writing format. 

üöÄ: I've put together a semi-technical checklist of open-source or free tools & topics in an effort to perhaps speed up discussions.  Also I'm using the 'rocket' as my spirit emoji, so when you see üöÄ: it's my @brians commentary. üòÅ

So this is sort of a 'notes' in progress/recap, and I'm putting this file in a tool called "GIT" which is a source-code version control system.  

# Working Totgether

ü•∞ "If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together." --african proverb. 

## Tools/Interfaces

 üçì Whenever possible, let's try to develop a common set of tools. Don't spend time re-inventing the wheel. 

### Pragmatic Mounting (Show & Tell)

1. DIN-35 Rail is the ISO mounting for anything electrical
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail

    ‚òùÔ∏è DIN-35 extrusions can be easily performed in cad-as-code



2. 2020 European "T" slot aluminum rail is awesome for making shapes & rails (these are commonly used with 3d printers).

    ‚òùÔ∏è 2020 is 20mm x 20mm, there's also 3030 4040, 2040, 2080, etc.

    They all use the "T" nuts, (of which there are many versions)
    The different versions include height & bolt size e.g. M3, M4, M5, M6
    They have lots of metal brackets, angles, etc. 

    Useful for adding structure, mounting gear assemblies, used as linear rails, any type of complex mechanism (namely because you can buy pre-made parts) these are most common foundational items. 
    
    (by using these it eliminates a huge amount of fabricating from nothing toil)

    There are many advantages to using the rail standard but the ability to remove & re-attach, adjust parts. 

At least for ETC prototypes, I'm suggesting these global industry standards, by having them, being aware of them.  

### Tooling

Tools - I have a 3020 CNC, really good at "thinking in CAD" (industrial parts design & assemblies of parts).  Also in terms of #irl fabrication & complexity reduction, assembly & wear and tear.   

I know how to use & design a CNC, and this includes steps in metal fabrication (not just plastic),  and punch or metal bending machines when/if get to that stage.  Figuring out a design that is 'manufacturable' includes the assembly and repair steps. 

We can either build or buy our own, or pay somebody else -- I've met with vendors in Malaysia, i.e. I can write up the ISO9000 assembly or fabrication steps for complex assemblies, prepare cad models, etc.   But 0.5mm is a good back-of-thumb error tolerance. 

I'm not a pro with my CNC yet and it's only a basic model. I have sets of mostly PCB drill bits, but I have a few more exotic drill bits as well. 

I've been busy wiring up end stop sensors and setting it up so the electronics don't get damaged when it's being used.  I ultimately want to be able to use water for cutting tile, brick, etc. and generally that's pretty messy and also considerations must be made when putting electronics & water together with a drill bit spinning @ 10,000 rpm. 

At least conceptually using the CNC we *could* manufacture prototypes of nearly any part of out clay, ceramic, metal, wood without much difficulty, in addition to our own circuits as needed.  

Plastic 3d is awesome for fast/cheap.  
I also have a 30cm X 30cm printer. 

I also have a 4k lithographic 3d printer as well, and that can do certain types of things (such as bridges) which an FDM 3d printer cant.  Also familiar with a lot of low tech methods for sand-casting, silicon casting, etc.  The lithographic printer uses UV curing resin, the material comes out something like 'uncooked pasta' in terms of both rigidy, strength and weight. 

There are times that metal, especially ferrous metals such as iron or bronze are necessary for electromagnetic behaviors.  

I also like to mention that Aluminum, lead, copper, tin, zinc and brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) are all non-ferrous.  Also, CNC's are incredibly useful for casting.  Iron(s) melt at ~1200 - 1,538 ¬∞C.   Using a CNC with a tungsten tip drill to (for example) carve out a brick, which can withstand those temperatures.  @Jamie: you asked me how I would make ammunition casings if I desired to 3d print firearms. ;-) 


@Warren, I hope these tools will influence what is within your capabilities - since you're obviously a tinker'er, and i'm happy to share what I know if or *either* Jamie are inclined to learn, the best way for me to master my skills is to share and communicate. So please don't feel like you're putting me out.   If something interesting commercial ever happens out of these I'd like to be remunerated but (at least with the solar panel table) this aligns with my own humanism ethos so I'm inclined to help you regardless.   @Jamie, obviously the same goes - when you're thinking about your materials, you might be printing in PLA for fitment, and then moving to metal.  

@Jamie -- the PV could be dumping extra power to wind a mechanical spring - this could boost the voltage during 'demand' periods.  (A small gear slip could occur after the spring is wound to it's maximum).  Using a nominal sized super-cap which charges to peak, then discharges into the spring or fly-wheel is another good way to store/dump power and doesn't cause or need light pollution with LED's.  If the LED's short, the panel is still a problem, and so the LED solution was quick & dirty, but it's after the battery 'storage' mechanism, so it's actually less reliable (i hope this makes sense, a lot of pieces can fail) and so having some *very* relible mechanism to dump the electrons is sort of requisite to having people & animals be in proximity.

## #Etc informal 

In terms of my goals -- I'm new to AU, I need friends, err. I mean "mates".  I need instruction on how to be more Australian, how to lose my accent and pronounce things properly.  That is surficially all I need at this point - some experience, very low expectations, cultural immersion.  In exchange I will offer all I know on Software Dev (RUST, Python, TypeScript/Javascript, Bash), Linux & Windows, Cloud architecture, Web3 &amp; Blockchain, Electronics, AI/ML, math, critical thinking, mycology and phytology. üòÜ

First rule: (rule zero), the only dumb question is the one you felt too dumb to ask.  

Second rule: DMMT "Dont Make Mates Think" (note, DMMT is *normally* shorthand for or Don't make ME think).  This is a defacto method of communication for async chat where links are provided, and additional context is provided as a courtesy.  DMMT when applied to async says "include sufficient context in electronic communications" .. i.e. don't make me google, instead provide a link, drawing, picture, etc. as an example.  The idea is to help your mates not need to expend significant calories to 'grok' a concept.  The intention is to help the other party understand it faster so they can provide more meaningful feedback earlier.

ü§ì https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok

At least for me - symbolic symbols help break up a document.  I use  emoji's as map symbols.  I use the 'nerd' emoji (informally named "Melvin") as a map legend for optional /additional reading/ for the epicurious.  A melvin denotes reference material. 

ü§ì Thinking is (i've read) may require as much as 35x less calories than communicating.  
    * https://time.com/5400025/does-thinking-burn-calories/

Also is a charged battery heavier? 
    https://www.quora.com/Is-a-charged-battery-heavier-than-a-depleted-one



The goal of an async message is to provide sufficient context so the other person can simply respond with an emoji such as üëç and not need clarification.  This reduces the back-and-forth clarification steps (causing small delays), it could (for example) eliminate the '10x wing problem' üòÜ .. thats one of my new favorite stories! 

@Warren in async convos - the expectation is you ar explictly providing context, what the expected deliverables are:  2x "PAIR" of wing molds for "RIGHT & LEFT", with 5x of each.  To further explicitly include "right and left wings are non-identical MIRROR images" - it helps the other person to understand the requirements, super useful in technical specifications since the others person should reasonably be expected to know that mirror images are not identical.   The goal ultimately is to reduce the 'UNFORCED ERRORS' (a mental model that correlates to the tennis term, that is discussed in Super Thinking).   

ü§ì UNFORCED ERRORS are *avoidable* errors that were within your locus of control that could have prevented with better planning/execution.

Separating errors into forced (unavoidable) and unforced (accidental) super helpful in Root Cause Analysis. 

This async approach towards comms is especially useful when working with people in foreign countries where English may not be their native language.

üöÄ: My dreams following our discussion were vivid & awes0me, and I'm the type of person who processes a lot during a sleep cycle.  My goal with this document is to propose one or more ways to perform asynchronous discussion & review and perhaps ultimately assign-todo tasks (i.e. review requests).  

I propose the rule is: If life gets busy, async waits. üòÜ  and so it's 'no worries' with regard. 


ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è the statement above "async waits", is a bit of a programming joke/nerd humor dealing with a javascript topic called "promises" in Javascript (which @Jamie, relates to functional programming & encapsuling ideas or logic into monadic/functors)
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)

 .. and conceptually, category theory, monadic behavior super useful when applied to TRIZ/TIPS.  
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ



üöÄ: Pragmatically I try to adhere to a ["Less Wrong"](https://www.lesswrong.com/) strategy which suggests that deferring any major life or project decisions until I've had at least 24 or 48 hours will slightly improve the outcomes.   

  Obviously there was A LOT of overlap in our mutual interests.  This is also called slow/fast thinking, and there is book written on the topic.  In terms of sharing links to books here
    * "How to Invent Everything: a survival guide for the stranded time traveler" is a 'fun' read:
        https://au1lib.org/book/3640091/312395

    * "Super Thinking"
        https://au1lib.org/book/5065660/0e795c  

@Warren: I wish I had asked to meet up a year ago.   I'm going to try and be as pragmatic as possible to sort of play catch-up for lost time if your also so inclined.  There were also moments in the conversation there and back to your home that I wish you would have been in the car with Jamie and myself.  Certainly leaving at the end discussion 'crypto' came up and so that left me with a literal TON of questions.



In order to really perform meaning collaboration on projects given our distance which is both 'not insignificant' by travel time, etc. but also 'insightnifcant' by Australian standards. üòÜ  My conclusion was some decentralized online tooling would allow our discussion(s) to continue in-between any in-person meetings.   

They would also be a handy & informal way to post requests or ideas for review or whatever.  I.e. "next time you're out can you bring a xyz connector" or "xyz project" so we can better time-scope our goals and actually be building, experimenting, etc. 

@Jamie: re-"the great Australian road-trip" .. I got @Wendy to *tenatively* agree that if you buy a van, I/we can also buy a van.     üòÜ 



 The first discussion(s) in my mind immediately surround tooling.   Tooling determines so much about what types of projects we could do, i.e. what will be easy & hard - especially in the digital sphere and starting to identify who has what skill, equipment, facility, etc.  but also pragmatically CAD, etc. 
 
 Warren - speaking directly, if you're so inclined - I'd love to collaborate on projects, it was clear to me there are skills I've curated that you are presently lacking,  but I also felt a lot of 'electro-chemistry' üòâ between us!  Really fun convo. 

We are presently linked on discord, sms.  I don't know if Discord is the best place - it's a tool. 

I use a dozen different chat protocols to correlate on different projects, each has pro's and con's.   This file is stored on GIT. 

Discord specifically is unencrypted, it is 'okay' for security, but would not be acceptable (for example) for sensitive areas such as key-exchange.  

I tend to be biased towards open-source tools, simply because I know I can usually add whatever features I want to them. 


# Tooling

* Project/Idea sharing

This file is hosted in GIT is a FREE open-source tool that is ubiquitious in software development, it allows decentralized software development & project coordination to occur at a plantary scale.  At this point at least 98% of the Internets critical infrastructure, and it just has patterns for solving a lot of problems, and it's especially useful for tracking/proposing/reviewing changes to text files - designed for source code, but it works well for any non-binary file.

* CAD software
